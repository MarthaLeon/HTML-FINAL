<h1>WILDLIFE IN SOUTH AMERICA</h1><!--Size of title - THe biggest size available-->

<p>Wildlife is being defined as undomesticated animal species and the ones that grow or live wild in an area without being introduced by humans. They</p>
<p>live in different ecosystems like deserts, plains,grasslands, woodlands, forest as well as in the most developed urban areas. Nowadays wildlife is</p>
<p>considered as valuable to human beings economically, educationally and emotionally in nature. In South America, we can find different endemic</p> 
<p>species of wildlife. Next you will find a brief description of some of them:</p>
